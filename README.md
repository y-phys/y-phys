  Information Secury Analyst |  Physics Undergraduate
  
  Currently pursuing a post-grad in AI & Cybersecurity.
  

  
  I love learning new stuff and - sometimes, hehe - falling down a rabbit hole.
  
  Also, I like to take notes and share them with others. Learning in public is a great method, which relies on publishing what you learn to help others while you also learn in the process of explaining.
