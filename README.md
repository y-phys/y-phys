## Hello :)

Information Security Analyst, focused on Application Security (AppSec) and pentesting. Currently doing a post-grad in AI & Cybersecurity.

I love learning new stuff and - sometimes, hehe - falling down a rabbit hole.

Also, I like to take notes and share them with others. Learning in public is a great method, which relies on publishing what you learn to help others while you also learn in the process of explaining :).
